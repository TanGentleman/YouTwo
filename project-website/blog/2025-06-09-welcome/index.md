## What is YouTwo?

YouTwo is a document processing system that transforms your markdown files, PDFs, and other documents into a rich knowledge graph. By extracting entities, identifying relationships, and generating semantic embeddings, YouTwo creates a comprehensive map of your personal knowledge.

## How it Works

The YouTwo document processing pipeline seamlessly transforms raw documents into structured knowledge:

1. **Upload & Parse**: Your documents are uploaded, parsed, and chunked for efficient processing
2. **Extract & Embed**: Entities are identified, and vector embeddings capture semantic meaning
3. **Connect & Visualize**: Relationships are discovered, and your knowledge graph comes to life

## Getting Started

Begin building your knowledge base by uploading your first document. The more content you add, the richer and more valuable your knowledge graph becomes.
