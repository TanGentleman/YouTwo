# YouTwo Architecture: A Comprehensive Overview

YouTwo is designed as an extensible, multi-source knowledge platform that can handle a wide variety of data sources and provide intelligent, context-aware responses. The architecture is built for extensibility, allowing for new data sources and processing layers to be added seamlessly.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Multi-Source Data Ingestion
- Journal entries with temporal context
- User-uploaded documents (PDFs, text, images)
- Real-time audio input via microphone
- Conversation histories
- Distilled knowledge artifacts (summaries, insights)
- *Extensible to:* Calendar events, emails, social media, IoT data streams

### 2. Multi-Layer Knowledge Processing
- **Source Layer:** Raw data processing with:
  - Semantic chunking
  - Metadata extraction
  - Vector embedding generation
- **Distillation Layer:** AI-enhanced processing:
  - Automatic summarization
  - Cross-document insight generation
  - Key information extraction
  - Temporal relationship mapping

### 3. Intelligent Query Processing
- Voice-to-text conversion for audio queries
- Context-aware retrieval from both source and distilled layers
- Dynamic filtering based on:
  - Temporal constraints
  - Content type
  - Relevance scoring
- Streamed responses with citations

### 4. Continuous Knowledge Enhancement
- Automatic indexing of conversations
- Distillation of interaction summaries
- Feedback-driven improvement loops
- Relevance-based retention policies

### 5. Extensible Architecture
- Plugin-based source connectors
- Modular processing pipelines
- Customizable distillation workflows
- Scalable vector database backend
- Multi-modal support (text, audio, images)

### 6. Agent Interaction System
- Turn-based conversational interface
- Context-preserving dialog management
- Tool-augmented responses
- Personalization based on interaction history

### 7. Advanced Knowledge Relationships
- Parent-child document linking
- Cross-repository references
- Temporal sequencing
- Thematic clustering
- Relevance-based knowledge graphs

## Implementation Highlights
- **Database Schema:** Flexible schemas for journals, conversations, and distilled artifacts
- **Vector Search:** 1536-dimension embeddings with metadata filtering
- **Real-time Processing:** Stream architecture for voice queries
- **Distillation Pipeline:** AI-generated summaries with source references
- **Extensibility Framework:** API-driven integration for new data sources

This architecture positions YouTwo as a personal knowledge platform that evolves with user interactions, transforming raw information into contextual insights while maintaining traceability to original sources. The system is designed to scale from personal journaling to enterprise knowledge management applications.
