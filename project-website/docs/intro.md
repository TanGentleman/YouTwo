# YouTwo: Document Processing Flow

Welcome to YouTwo, your personal knowledge platform. This guide explains how YouTwo processes documents and builds your knowledge graph.

## Document Processing Pipeline

YouTwo transforms your documents into structured knowledge through a seamless pipeline:

1. **Document Upload**
   - Upload markdown files, PDFs, or other document types
   - Documents are securely stored for processing
   - Original source files are preserved for reference

2. **Document Parsing**
   - Text extraction from various file formats
   - Semantic chunking for better context preservation
   - Indexing to Vectara for powerful semantic search capabilities
   - Metadata extraction (timestamps, titles, authors)

3. **Journal Entry Creation**
   - Each document becomes a journal entry in the system
   - Temporal metadata is preserved (creation time, content timeframe)
   - Documents are linked to their source files

4. **Embedding Generation**
   - Vector embeddings are created for semantic similarity matching
   - 1536-dimension embeddings capture document meaning
   - Embeddings power similarity search and content relationships

5. **Entity Extraction**
   - AI identifies key entities mentioned in documents
   - Entities categorized by type (people, concepts, places, etc.)
   - Observations about entities are extracted and stored

6. **Relation Identification**
   - Connections between entities are automatically discovered
   - Relationship types are categorized and labeled
   - Temporal and contextual aspects of relationships are preserved

7. **Knowledge Graph Update**
   - Entities and relationships are integrated into the knowledge graph
   - New information reinforces or extends existing knowledge
   - Graph visualization provides insights into your knowledge network

## Using the Knowledge Graph

Once documents are processed, you can:

- Search semantically across all your content
- Discover relationships between concepts and ideas
- Find similar documents based on meaning, not just keywords
- Visualize your knowledge as an interconnected graph
- Ask questions that draw from multiple documents

## Getting Started

To begin building your knowledge base:

1. Upload your first document using the upload button
2. Watch as YouTwo processes it through the pipeline 
3. Explore the extracted entities and relationships
4. Ask questions about your document to see the system in action

The more documents you add, the richer your knowledge graph becomes.
